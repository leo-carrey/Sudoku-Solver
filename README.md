we're a group of 3 people and we need to create an application with a graphical interface for solving sudoku grids. We need to solve this algorithm in two different ways: one by backtracking and the other by brute force.

## üßê Features    
- Change grids to solve
- Change solving methods
- Solve


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com//)
- [Github](https://github.com//)
- [Trello](https://trello.com/b/PxiTtLhP/sudoku-solver/)
    

# <p align="center">üôá Study about time of execution</p>
  
In a table, we have collected execution time data for each grid.
We ran the program 4 times to obtain a meaningful comparison.

## üßê Conclusion   
- We can see that for grids 1, 2, 3, 4, the execution time decreases after each execution.
- The higher the number of unknowns, the longer it will take the program to execute.
- Grid 5 has 58 unknowns, and unlike the others, its execution time increases.
